# {{#<issue> — what this slice delivers}}

> **This plan is written to be executed by task-scoped subagents that arrive with zero context
> and decide nothing.** Every task carries the current state of what it touches (copied
> verbatim), the contracts it honours and the exact commands that verify it; its bodies are
> yours to write, test-first. Names, signatures, constants and test names come from this
> document, which decided them. On ambiguity, the issue body and AGENTS.md win.

## 1. Context and goal

{{Current state of the code this slice touches, with real paths and symbols. What the issue
asks for, in one paragraph.}}

### Desired end state

{{Concrete list of what exists when every task is done — mirror the issue's acceptance
criteria.}}

### Out of scope

{{What this slice deliberately does not do — start from the issue's "Out of scope /
Protected" section. If nothing: N/A — <reason>.}}

## 2. Closed decisions (take as given)

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| {{decision}} | {{an order: one value, stated}} |

## 3. Reference patterns

{{Repository conventions and exemplars: `--check-plan` rejects paths that do not exist.
The program carries ct's yardstick separately.}}

Files to imitate: {{analogous files, same role and layer; or N/A — <reason>.}}

Rules to obey: {{start with `.agent/conventions.md`; then applicable `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `docs/conventions/` paths and skills named by the issue
(skill names are not checked on disk). Or N/A — this repo declares none.}}

Responsibility trace: {{apply "Responsibility ownership" in ct's
`conventions/architecture.md` to this capability; name paths and symbols, including
the operation behind each relevant port. Explain any role with no work here.}}

## 4. Inventory

| File | Action | Consumed by | Block in §7 |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{path}} | create / modify | {{who}} | Contract / Call site / Current state / Final text / prose (config) / none (body by TDD) |

## 5. Interfaces

Consumes: {{the interface the issue declares for its dependency — names and signatures inline,
in prose; or N/A — no dependencies. If it has to be quoted from the repo, quote it inside
the task that consumes it, with `Current state (path, lines A-B):`.}}
Produces: {{what later slices rely on — one exported name and signature per line, in prose:
the block lives in the task that creates the file, which is what the task brief carries. Or
N/A — <reason>.}}

## 6. Test strategy

{{What gets tested and how, following AGENTS.md commands. If a task carries no tests, say so
here with the reason, so the implementer knows it is deliberate.}}

## 7. Tasks

### Task 1 — {{name}}

**Objective:** {{one sentence: the observable behavior this commit delivers}}

**Files:** {{exact paths between backticks, each marked (create) or (modify)}}

Current state (path/to/file.ext, lines A-B):

{{ONLY the stretch that changes, max 12 lines, copied verbatim from the repo — the validator
greps it.}}

Contract (path/to/file.ext):

{{Max 25 lines: types, interfaces, exact signatures, typed errors, and constants the implementer
cannot derive (formats, flags, magic values). Declarations only: bodies are written test-first.}}

Call site (path/to/consumer.ext):

{{Max 10 lines, before -> after: how the call reads in the consumer once this task is done —
route, handler, component usage.}}

Final text (path/to/doc.md):

{{Max 12 lines, text artifacts only (.md/.txt/.rst/.adoc): the exact replacement wording, and
only claims you verified against the repo. Code and configuration travel by their own labels.}}

{{Configuration (tsconfig, package.json, CI workflows, lockfiles) travels as prose with the
value inline. A task whose work carries no block says so with the exact line:
No code — <reason>. Blocks add up to 30 lines per task, and each task fits on ONE A4 page:
3500 characters. If a task does not fit, the task is two: one task is one commit.}}

**TDD:** {{red first: literal test name and the assertion that pins the boundary → minimal green
| No TDD — <reason>}}

**Tests:** {{added: named one by one / removed on purpose: named one by one | N/A — <reason>}}

**Verification:** {{what the commands prove, in prose if it helps — the commands themselves go
in the fenced block below, one per line, already run. A program executes that block, so it
carries commands and `--check-plan` rejects a task without one.}}

```bash
{{command}}   # {{expected: exit 0 — the comment says what exit 0 will mean here}}
```

{{The program scores this block by EXIT CODE and nothing else, so every command is a predicate:
a command whose exit code IS the claim. Anything you assert about a count, a line or a piece of
output goes inside `test`: `test "$(… | grep -c 'x')" -eq 2`, `test "$(wc -l < f)" -le 150`,
`test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"`. Keep the claim in the command and out of the comment:
`grep -c` exits 0 for "found at least one" and 1 for "found none", so
`grep -c … # expected: 0` goes green exactly when it should go red. `--check-plan` rejects the
commands it can prove cannot measure their own claim.}}

### Task 2 — {{name}}

**Objective:** {{...}}

**Files:** {{...}}

{{Same four block roles, same budgets.}}

**TDD:** {{... | No TDD — <reason>}}

**Tests:** {{... | N/A — <reason>}}

**Verification:** {{...}}

```bash
{{command}}   # {{expected: exit 0 — a predicate, as in Task 1}}
```

## 8. Global verification

{{End-to-end validation once every task is committed. A program runs it (`ct-step global`,
after the last commit), so the commands go in a fenced block — each one a predicate, exit 0,
same rules as a task's **Verification:** block. Prose before and after the block is welcome:
what to start, what to look at with human eyes. A slice with no end-to-end to run
(documentation, pure configuration) declares it with the exact line `N/A — <reason>` instead
of a block; `--check-plan` rejects a §8 that is only prose.}}

```bash
{{command}}   # {{expected: exit 0 — a predicate, as in every task}}
```

## 9. Assumptions

{{Numbered: every ambiguity resolved without asking, what was decided, and its provenance
(issue / epic context / repo convention / own call).}}
