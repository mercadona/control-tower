# What a diff does not add

Applies to: **every diff**.

One rule, and the rest of this document is the shapes it takes: **the burden of proof is on what is added, and
it is discharged against the problem being solved today**. "It might one day"
does not discharge it.

**Nothing here authorises dropping a layer.** The layers between the parts
of a system, the ports between them and the value objects are how a system
is built, not complexity to trim. What is trimmed is what defends against
what cannot happen.

## The guard lives where the value enters from outside

The check on what a value carries happens once, at the door the outside value
arrives through: the shape that reads a request, the type built from what an
external answer printed. Downstream of that door every caller is code this
diff already trusts, so a second opinion about the same content defends
against a caller that does not exist. The question is not where the value came
from but whose responsibility this is: the thing built at the door owns its
own check, and forms no second opinion about a value another part of the
system already vouched for. The guard a value object keeps for itself, once
it exists, is `conventions/domain.md`'s business, not this one's.

## A field, a branch and a public symbol answer to a call that exists

Not to one that could exist. A field that crosses a layer, a parameter with a
default, a branch for a state, a method made public, an export: each is
justified by a caller that exists today and by nothing else. What is added
for a consumer that has not arrived is carried by every layer it crosses
until someone removes it, and that someone has to prove first that nobody
uses it.

The question: **which call breaks without it?** Name it. If none does, it goes.

That establishes necessity, not placement. **Responsibility ownership** in
`conventions/architecture.md` measures whether that necessary code has the right owner.

## An unreachable check is not a check

A condition on a state that cannot occur — a key that cannot repeat, a value
that cannot be missing at that point, a case the branch beside it already
handles — protects nothing and reads as if it did. A surviving mutant at that
line has two possible repairs, not one: the test nobody wrote, or the line
nobody needs. Which of the two, `conventions/testing.md` decides.

## Observability answers to a reader who exists

A log line, a metric, a trace, a field in an answer: each names who reads it
and what they do differently for having read it. A line nobody reads is noise
in the channel of the lines someone does read. What exists only to produce
it — the wiring built for it, the checks written against it — leaves with it.

The question: **who reads this, and where?**

## A request from a review or a judgement is not exempt

The burden of proof does not move when the addition is asked for by a reviewer,
a verifier or a judge. Nothing about a review makes a guard reachable or gives
a field a caller. A review that looks for what is missing finds it, and
complying costs less than answering — which is how these accumulate, each one
reasonable on its own.

Where the burden cannot be discharged, that is declared in the task's
report, where whoever judges reads it, and the decision is left to a
person.

## What other documents own, and this one does not repeat

- A **new module**: `conventions/architecture.md`.
- **What a check is missing, and what is left unmeasured on purpose**:
  `conventions/testing.md`.
- **What the door itself owes to what arrives through it**:
  `conventions/boundaries.md`.
- **What the plan asked for is a different question from this one.** That
  question is about the sentence a task traces back to; this one is about the
  caller that would break without the addition. A plan can ask for a field
  that no caller in the tree uses — that gap is measured here, not there.

## Antipatterns

- A second check on what a value carries, downstream of the door it came in by.
- A field crossing a layer with no consumer at the other end.
- A public symbol, a parameter or a default with no caller.
- A condition on a state that cannot occur, with a check that can only fail if
  the layer above it changes.
- A log line, a trace or a field of an answer with no reader named.
- An addition implemented because a review asked for it, with the burden of
  proof undischarged.
